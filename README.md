# Agentic Research Framework: Tool-Using Research Agents with LLMs

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is a practical framework for building **research agents**—AI systems that can reason, use tools, and make decisions when analyzing complex, unstructured data. Unlike standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this framework enables agents to intelligently navigate, retrieve, summarize, and compare information across multiple documents with autonomous reasoning capabilities.

You'll build increasingly advanced agents across four modules, from simple query routing to autonomous multi-step reasoning over research documents.

## 🧠 What You’ll Build

### 1. 🧭 Router Agent (Basic Agentic RAG)
A simple agent that routes a query to either a:
- **Q&A engine** or
- **Summarization engine**

...based on the nature of the query and using a single document as context.

### 2. 🛠️ Tool-Calling Agent
Extend the router to:
- Use an LLM to **select a tool** (function)
- Infer the **arguments** to pass to it
- Automatically execute the correct function

### 3. 🧑‍💻 Research Assistant Agent (Multi-Step Reasoning)
A multi-step agent that:
- Plans and sequences tool use
- Refines its reasoning iteratively
- Operates autonomously over tools to build answers

### 4. 📚 Multi-Document Research Agent
A full-fledged research agent that:
- Works with **multiple documents**
- Selects what to read, what to ignore
- **Adapts its retrieval strategy** based on what it learns
- Summarizes and compares findings across papers (e.g. arXiv preprints)

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Tool Use**: Function calling with LLMs (e.g., summarizers, search engines)
- **Agentic Reasoning**: Multi-step logic and planning with memory
- **Query Routing**: Dynamic selection of execution paths
- **Autonomous Research**: Smart information extraction and comparison across texts
